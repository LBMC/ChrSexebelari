# TP for experimental biologists

The Goal of this practical is to learn how to build your own pipeline with nextflow and using the tools already *wrapped* in Docker and SGE.

## Initialize your own project

You are going to build a pipeline for you or your team. So the first step is to create your own project.

Instead of reinventing the weel, you can use the [pipelines/nextflow](https://gitlab.biologie.ens-lyon.fr/pipelines/nextflow) as a template.
To easily do so, go to the [pipelines/nextflow](https://gitlab.biologie.ens-lyon.fr/pipelines/nextflow) repository and click on the [**fork**](https://gitlab.biologie.ens-lyon.fr/pipelines/nextflow/forks/new) button.

In git, the action of forking means that you are going to make your own private copy of a repository.
